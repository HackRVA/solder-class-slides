## Requirements

To build this, you need Latex Beamer. Your best bet for getting this
in ubuntu is to install the texlive-full package. It's
enormous. Somewhere around two GBs.

I used pdflatex, and AUCTex in emacs to make this little sucker go-round.

I've uploaded the resulting PDF as well.

If anyone planning on taking the class has any thoughts before or
after I give it, feel free to drop me a line on the Hackrva Mailing
List at hackrva.org
